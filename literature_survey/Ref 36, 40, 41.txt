The final security parameter of randomness extractor 
(i.e. statistical distance between output distribution 
and a perfect-random distribution) is a function of 
input data size n. In the infinite key limit, the output 
of randomness extractor is determined by the min-entropy. 
In general, randomness extractors are quite efficient 
(close to 100% for a reasonable input data size, such as 100Mbits).
